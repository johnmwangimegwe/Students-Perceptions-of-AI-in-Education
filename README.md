# Students' Perceptions and Insights on the Role of AI in Education

## Project Overview
This project investigates undergraduate students' perceptions of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education, focusing on students enrolled at the Faculty of Cybernetics, Statistics, and Economic Informatics. It identifies key sources of AI knowledge, perceptions of societal and economic impacts, emotional attitudes towards AI, and expectations for AI integration in education. The results inform policymakers, educational institutions, and EdTech companies to better align AI development with student needs.

## Problem Statement
There is a significant gap in empirical understanding of how future digital professionals perceive AI's role in education. Without student-centered insights, educational strategies may fail, causing inefficiencies, rejection of AI tools, and mistrust. Bridging this gap ensures successful, ethical, and accepted AI deployment.

## Target Audience
- University Administration and Faculty
- EdTech Companies & AI Developers
- Policymakers in Education and Technology
- Academic Researchers and Think Tanks
- Student Career Services

## Research Questions
1. What is the students’ level of knowledge about AI, and which sources do they most commonly use to learn about it?
2. What are the dominant attitudes toward AI’s societal effects (dehumanization, job replacement, problem solving, AI ruling society)?
3. How do students perceive the economic impacts of AI (cost, economic crisis, economic growth, job loss)?
4. What emotions do students associate with AI (Curiosity, Fear, Indifference, Trust)?
5. Which sectors do students believe AI will impact most significantly?
6. Do students believe AI leads to job loss or global economic growth?
7. What are students’ perceptions of AI usefulness in education?
8. What are the perceived main advantages of AI in teaching, learning, and evaluation?
9. What is the main disadvantage students foresee with AI in education?
10. Is there any correlation between students' perceived AI knowledge and perceived AI usefulness?

## Background
Globally and in Romania, AI has steadily transformed educational practices since the 1960s. While enabling real-time feedback, personalized learning, and automation, AI also raises concerns: dehumanization, job loss, and system over-dependence. Ethical, user-centered AI deployment based on student perceptions is crucial for sustainable integration.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection:** Online survey distributed via social media groups, targeting second- and third-year undergraduate students (n = 91).
- **Data Cleaning:** Recoding qualitative responses into quantitative scales using Excel.
- **Data Analysis:** Pivot tables, normalized percentages, and various chart types (bar, stacked, donut, funnel, scatter).
- **Dashboard Development:** A structured, color-coded Excel dashboard was created for interactive storytelling.

## Results and Discussion
- Most students rate their AI knowledge between 5-8.
- 44% use the Internet as the primary learning source.
- 66% agree AI solves societal problems; 35% fear job replacement.
- 36% fully agree AI will foster economic growth.
- Curiosity and trust dominate emotional responses.
- Medicine (80%) and Education (67%) are seen as primary AI impact areas.
- 23% rate AI usefulness in education at maximum (10/10).
- Main advantages: AI Assistants in teaching (43%), Universal Access in learning (53%), and Constant Feedback in evaluation (49%).
- Main disadvantage: Loss of student-teacher relationship (37%).
- Positive correlation between AI knowledge and perceived usefulness.

## Conclusion
Students show cautious optimism towards AI, recognizing its educational and economic potential while voicing concerns about job security and relational dynamics. Improving AI literacy directly enhances student acceptance of AI technologies.

## Recommendations
- Integrate comprehensive AI education into curricula.
- Develop AI tools that preserve human interactions.
- Design inclusive, student-centered AI applications.
- Enforce ethical guidelines for educational AI deployment.
- Continuously collect student feedback to adapt strategies.
